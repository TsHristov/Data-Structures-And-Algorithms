# Data-Structures-And-Algorithms

Exercise repository in which I will strive to implement famous data structures and algorithms both in Python and C++.
Each has a README description with operations costs analysis.
* `Data-Structures`:
  - `Dynamic-Array`  - C++ implementation + improvised Unit Tests
  - `Linked-List`    - C++ implementation + improvised Unit Tests
  - `Priority-Queue` - Python implementation + Unit Tests
  - `Stack`
    - C++ implementation using `DynamicArray` + improvised Unit Tests


# Resources: / I only used the books as a reference, I strived for my own implementations /
* `Algorithms, Fourth Edition by Robert Sedgewick`
* `Data Structures And Algorithms In Python by Michael T. Goodrich`
