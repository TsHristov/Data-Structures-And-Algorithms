# Data-Structures-And-Algorithms

Exercise repository in which I will strive to implement most famous data structures and algorithms in both Python and C++.
* `Data-Structures`:
  - `Dynamic-Array`  - C++ implementation + improvised Unit Tests
  - `Priority-Queue` - Python implementation + Unit Tests

# Resources: / I only used the books as a reference, I strived for my own implementations /
* `Algorithms, Fourth Edition by Robert Sedgewick`
* `Data Structures And Algorithms In Python by Michael T. Goodrich`
