# Data-Structures-And-Algorithms

Exercise repository with implementations of famous data structures and algorithms both in Python and C++.
Each has a detailed description with operations costs analysis.
* `Data-Structures`:
  - `Dynamic-Array`
    - C++ implementation + improvised Unit Tests
  - `Linked-List`
    - C++ implementation + improvised Unit Tests
    - Python implementation + Unit Tests
  - `Priority-Queue` - Python implementation + Unit Tests
  - `Stack`
    - C++ implementation using `Dynamic-Array` + improvised Unit Tests
    - C++ implementation using `Linked-List`   + improvised Unit Tests
    - Python implementation using the built-in Python List class + Unit Tests
  - `Queue`
    - Python implementation using `Linked-List` + Unit Tests
